# WUSS2021_Python_Advanced_ML
The advanced Python programming seminar will cover more advanced Python programming. It is recommended for those who took morning seminar or last year’s Python course, or for those who have some knowledge, but want to learn more advanced Python programming. This seminar will also cover Machine Learning implementation using Python.
